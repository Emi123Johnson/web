Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the
fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It
is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser
and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational
compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average
distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea
and has the astronomical symbol â™†, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek
letter psi.

<p><font size=4>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball
of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the
energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most
important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres
(864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth; it
accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the
Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller
quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.
The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is
informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white
than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of
matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center,
whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass
5became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that
almost all stars form by this process.

<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and
support life. 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining
70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also
by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's
polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates
that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with
a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective
mantle that drives plate tectonics.
Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by
tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation.
Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's
climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating
oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and
heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.</p>
