<div style="background-color:PINK;color:black;padding:10px;">
<h2 style="color:white;">SEDAN</h2>
<p style="color:white;">A sedan has four doors and a traditional trunk. Like vehicles in
many categories, they're available in a range of sizes from small (subcompact vehicles
like Nissan Versa and Kia Rio) to compacts (Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla) to mid-size
(Honda Accord, Nissan Altima), and full-size (Toyota Avalon, Dodge Charger). Luxury
brands like Mercedes-Benz and Lexus have sedans in similar sizes as well.</p>

<h2 style="color:white;">COUPE</h2>
<p style="color:white;">A coupe has historically been considered a two-door car with a
trunk and a solid roof. This would include cars like a Ford Mustang or Audi A5—or even
two-seat sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette and Porsche Boxster. Recently, however,
car companies have started to apply the word "coupe" to four-door cars or crossovers
with low, sleek rooflines that they deem "coupe-like."
9This includes vehicles as disparate as a Mercedes-Benz CLS sedan and BMW X6 SUV.
At Car and Driver, we still consider a coupe to be a two-door car.</p>

<h2 style="color:white;">STATION WAGON</h2>
<p style="color:white;">Wagons are similar to sedans but have an extended roofline and
a hatch door at the rear instead of a trunk. Some, like the Subaru Outback or Audi A4
Allroad, have elevated ground clearance and some rugged body cladding to make them
more like a sport-utility vehicle (SUV), but they are nonetheless closely related to sedans.
Wagons have fallen from favor during the past few decades and there are relatively few
available for sale in the United States.</p>
